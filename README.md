# Bina's dots

Welcome to my dotfiles repo, home to my first ever rice :3

I've chosen to utilize the Hyprland tiling window manager as the heart of my personalized Linux environment. Pywal as the color-scheme generator adapts to any wallpaper, ensuring a harmonious visual experience throughout my setup making it simple to tailor the ambiance to match my current mood. 

Feel free to explore my files and reach out to me with any questions or suggestions. Let's dive into the world of Linux customization together!
